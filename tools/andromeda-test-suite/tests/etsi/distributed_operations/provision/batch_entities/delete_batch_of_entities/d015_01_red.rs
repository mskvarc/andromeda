/// Pins: Check that if one requests the Context Broker to delete a batch of entities that match a redirect
/// registration, they are deleted on the Context Source
/// Clause: 4.3.3, 4.3.6.3, 5.6.10
/// Changed: the context source is the test's own server in place of the suite's HTTP control server: the registration
/// names its address, each Set Stub Reply is a stub matched in the order it was set by the server's rule (case,
/// trailing slashes, the query tokens, the attrs and urn rules), and a request no stub matches is answered 502 after
/// 5 s where the server closes the connection.
/// Changed: the registration's idPattern urn:ngsi-ld:Vehicle:* becomes `urn:ngsi-ld:Vehicle:<ns>-.*`: a request that
/// names no entity type matches a registration on the id alone (clause 5.12), so the pattern as written would draw
/// every other test's requests on a Vehicle id into this test's source.
/// Changed: Get Stub Count counts the requests of the source the stub's rule matches.
/// Changed: the teardown deletes of the registrations are held to the 204 a deleted registration answers, not only to
/// a status below 400.
